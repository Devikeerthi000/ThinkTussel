**ThinkTussel**

A debate simulation platform that stages a structured argument between two AI agents.

**Project Overview**

ThinkTussel is a web-based application that simulates formal debates between two roles — a Proponent and an Opponent — on any topic the user provides. The system generates multiple rounds of responses and concludes with a reasoned judgment. The interface is styled to deliver a polished and distraction-free experience.

**Example**

Topic: Should college education be free?

Proponent: Argues for universal access to education.

Opponent: Highlights economic and practical constraints.

Judgment: Provided at the end based on the quality of reasoning.
