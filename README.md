ThinkTussel
A debate simulation platform that stages a structured argument between two AI agents.

Project Overview
ThinkTussel is a web-based application that simulates formal debates between two roles — a Proponent and an Opponent — on any topic the user provides. The system generates multiple rounds of responses and concludes with a reasoned judgment. The interface is styled to deliver a polished and distraction-free experience.

Example Use Case
Topic: Should college education be free?

The Proponent argues in favor of free education.

The Opponent provides counterpoints.

The system presents a multi-round debate and a concluding judgment based on the arguments made.
